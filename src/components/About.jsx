          Hey there! I'm Dhruv Anand Singh. You can also call me Rico. I'm just your friendly neighborhood MERN Stack Developer. I get a kick out of building awesome web apps with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. When I'm not in coding mode, you might find me hustling on the badminton court or just chilling with my favorite tunes .

And here's the fun part, I'm an absolute PokÃ©mon geek! The PokÃ©mon world is like my escape pod. Let's team up, bring some cool ideas to life, and enjoy the journey together. Can't wait to chat and create something amazing! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ¸
